# Science for Kids

## Demo

A live demo of the finished project can be found [here](https://francesjgonzales.github.io/periodicTableProj2/).

---

## Aim

1. Introduce basic foundation of Chemistry to kids.
2. Teach them how to read the Periodic Table.
3. Get them involved in science experiments at home.

# UX

### Research and Strategy

#### Stakeholder information:

1. Kids at the age of 10 years old who has the basic foundation of Science.
   - Primary 3 starts taking up science subject.
2. Kids as young as 6 years old can engage in fun experiments.

#### Scope

1. Keep the readers engage
2. User goal: make them reach to periodic table page and explore the elements

How I started.

1. Find out the age on when kids can start learning Chemistry.
   - Primary 3 starts taking up science subject.
2. Introduce the basics of Periodic Table - Primary 4 (10yrs old and above)
3. Add on easy science experiments for younger kids (6yr)

#### Structure

1. Refered to [Chem4Kids] (http://www.chem4kids.com/) to use as main content on Chemistry.
2. Narrowed down the key topics to the following:
   - About Chemistry
   - Matter
   - Atom
   - Elements & Reaction
     - Periodic Table

#### UI

I researched in [awwwards.com] (https://www.awwwards.com/) and [dribbble.com] (https://dribbble.com/) for kids websites

1. Fonts - I used 1 type of font that gives a readable look
2. The website consist of main page and 1 sub page.
   - Main page has the following content
     1. Chemistry (introduction)
     2. Matter
     3. Atom
     4. Elements & Reaction (Short for Chemical Reaction)
   - Periodic Table (sub page)
     1. Young Chemist (includes videos about fun experiments.)
3. Colours used are striking and images are more cartoon-like for engagement.
4. Original content from Chem4Kids website are mostly in paragraph format. I break the long-winded text and added mark on keywords and inserted images in between to keep the engagement going.
5. This is not responsive and suitable for ipad as periodic table cannot be collapsed.

## Features

#### The website will feature the following:

1. Main page - included youtube videos and illustrations.
2. Sub page - the periodic table and fun experiements that shows videos.
3. Return to top page

#### Features left to implement

- Shows more information on each element when clicked or hovered.
- Create interactive quiz on each topics

## Testing

I shared this with my 10 year old son. Noticed his reaction has stopped on the part with videos.
These instructions / questions where given and asked to him while browsing the website.

- What is the website about?
- Do you understand it is about?
- Which part do you like the most in the website?

Below is a detailed steps when user tested the website
